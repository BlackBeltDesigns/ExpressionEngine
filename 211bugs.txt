1. When installing above web root the value for 'URL to the directory where the above index page is located' is the masked file URL and not the site root.

5. Default, Fruit and Corporate theme, going to Content > File Manager generates a console error:
"TypeError: Result of expression 'a' [undefined] is not an object"
in index.php?S=8bda723f8890679f6b3534108001a7194c9717fa&D=cp&C=javascript

6. Safari 5.0.2 Inspector reports multiple HTML validation errors in Config Editor in Default and Fruit themes.

9. Corporate theme publish tab, the glossary won't open on a textarea using Chrome 6.0.472.62 beta.

12. When modifying the publish layout it is possible to drag the entry date field off the layout and it disappears completely. This should not be possible since the entry date can't be removed.

13. Corporate theme with Chrome 6.0.472.62 beta/Safari 5.0.2 and Firefox 4.0b5, going to the Content Edit page generates several JS errors and the page does not render properly. Does not occur in Default or Fruit themes.

17. IE8 (Windows 7), the file manager upload dialog (from the publish page) does not have a choose file button. The dialog will open if the field is double-clicked though.

19. Occasionally (I can't see a pattern here) if you click an image in the file manager list the modal is offset to the right partially out of the browser viewport. It is not possible to click to close this image. A JS error is generated "Cannot read property 'nodeName' of '. This seems to happen with at least Mac Chrome and Windows 7.

20. Safari/Chrome/Firefox, after logging in with the mobile theme and trying to select another theme it is not then possible to change the default CP theme in a desktop browser.


- Re: (#13363) where {page_url} variables were not respecting the "Force Query Strings" setting
>> Forcing query strings breaks {page_url} (http://site/index.php/?/pagetest (extra slash before and after ?)

- Re: Greg's #19 I'm also still seeing a JS error when uploading a file from the File Manager which is a bit of a biggie because it prevents feedback.  "Click is not a function" occurs on line 139 of file_manager_home.js, presumably because something isn't fully in the DOM when setup_events() gets run again following the upload? (this is the only JS error I have encountered in the CP)

- Comment Editing Time Limit setting in the module's new CP page is ambiguous as to what units of time are being specified (the documentation does not specify this either)

- Was not able to get Moblog to work with my Gmail account. It did connect on port 995 (whether I set the Incoming Mail Server to pop.gmail.com or pop.gmail.com:995) but appeared to go around in circles for approximately a minute (just watching tcpdump) and then say No Emails Found.

- (minor) When I gave a known-bad password Moblog detected this but returned somewhat contradictory output (invalid password + successfully checked):


---------- DOCUMENTATION -----------

- the channel= parameter is listed out-of-order on modules/channel/parameters.html
- typo in changelog: "Added a new status for comments. Moderated comments will no go..." should be "...now go..."
- {last_segment} is not documented in templates/globals/single_variables.html
- Re: #13551 Search and Replace in conjunction with flat files could lead to data loss - Documentation and screenshot at cp/tools/data/search_and_replace.html do not reflect the new warning in the S&R utility (If you are replacing within templates, synchronize with the database first, or	permanent data loss can occur!)  Ideally the utility would refuse to run if templates are out of sync...?
- Both links in the changelog re: restrict_channel parameter and show_empty parameter have an extra /channel/ in their URL 
- Suggest tweak to new documentation on restrict_channel: "... When restrict_channel is set to "no", the show_empty parameter will display categories that have no entries from all channels, rather than categories that have no entries from the specified channel. (break) By default, the empty categories shown will be restricted to the specified channel."



--------- WORKING ON IT -------------

- When installing above web root it's still necessary to manually change the config file because of 'Unable to load the requested file: account/login.php' (PK)

- Filemanger: Edit > crop mode, makes the image disappear on the first attempt - fails with NaN in all fields (PK)

- 18. When uploading images via the file manager sometimes the file is uploaded to the server successfully but the file manager dialog does not recognise or record this fact when it is refreshed. In at least Chrome several JS errors are generated. See also #19. (PK)


--------- FIXED / NOT A BUG ----------

- #13568 (Modules without CP backends never updated)
- Publish page improvements look good and appear to work well, including field drag and drop to other tabs. Only suggestion would be to change the mouse pointer when over a field's grippie similar to the feedback when you hover over the 'resize' corner of a field.

- {last_segment} will let you access a 10th segment, however the individual segment variables only access up to {segment_9} (is this by design?)

Missing column notify in field list when posting a comment

3. With Safari 5.0.2 the Comment module homepage overlaps the ExpressionEngine Info accessory tab when opening/closing the sidebar.

4. Comment module homepage, without any comments the pagination links, an empty select and a submit button are shown.

7. Corporate theme, the File Manager overlaps the accessory tabs if the sidebar is opened/closed.

8. {last_segment} seems to work as described.

10. After publishing an entry the preview shows a 'View Comments' link. This link is incorrect.

11. Changelog link for new 'restrict_channel' parameter is incorrect.

14. Complex publish layouts successfully tested including removal of url_title field and dragging of fields between tabs.

15. #13175 successful manual change of AM/PM on entry date.

16. #13829 verified

21. #13071, verified that ctrl+shortcut does work in Safari 5.0.2/Firefox 4.0b5/Chrome 6.0.472.62 beta. Selected text is wrapped appropriately.

- (#13585) where the Wiki would not accept uploads if the allowed types was set to "Images only"
- (#13503) where deleting tabs from the publish layout could cause kept tabs to be mislabeled.
- (#13575) where the CP search was looking in the wrong location for language keys.
- (#13071) with HTML formatting buttons where the shortcut keys (Ctrl+key) were not working.
- IE8 works as well as can be expected (can't reproduce Greg's #17 albeit with IE8 on XP)
- Lots of other general usage patterns that worked well
