 Westhill and Elrick Community

Welcome to the new Westhill and Elrick Community website.

This site has been established by Westhill & Elrick Community Council (W&ECC;) to bring together and promote the diverse range of community groups active in the area. It is hoped that as the website progresses more and more local groups will join us to promote what they do in the local community and that this site will be a one-stop shop to find out what's going on in Westhill & Elrick.

W&ECC; was formed in 2008 having formerly been the Westhill & District Residents Association.

Community Councils are statutory bodies whose main aims are to represent the views and take action to promote the interest of the community. Community Councils can carry out a variety of roles including campaigning on local issues, supporting and encouraging other community organisations, helping with environmental projects, commenting on local planning and other issues and conducting local surveys.

W&ECC; meet every second Thursday of each month at 7pm usually in the Staff Room, Westhill Academy and all local residents are most welcome.
