take 7 dates in the morning It was very weird that western physicians who treat their patients by fasting advise them by taking the natural sugar in fruits and water when breaking the fast . And when we know that dates contain a high ratio of such easily-absorbed sugar then dates and water are the best nutriments for fasters.

Here we remember the Hadith of our prophet (PBUH): (When any of you breaks his fasting he should eat dates cause dates are blessing, if he didn't find dates then drink water cause water is purifying) [Narrated by Abo Dawood] . Here we see that the prophet (PBUH) showed us the principles of effective fasting, by eating dates and drinking water at breakfast centuries before Westerns.

An Ideal Nutriment for Fasters

The prophetic wisdom out of having Dates for breakfast might be reduce the hunger and consequently, reduce the amounts of food consumed; therefore the fasting will be effective and useful. And if we remember that fasting consider the best weapon to excise toxics out of the body, then having dates (toxin-resistive) when you break your fast represent a real integrated treatment against weakness and fatigue resulted from the accumulation of toxic chemicals and heavy metals in the cells of the body.

if you are feeling weak, don't hesitate to take 7 dates in the morning as the prophet (PBUH) recommended. those Seven dates weigh around 70 gm, so if you take them, then you actually took 70 milligrams of calcium-which is very useful for the bones, joints and nerves, 35 milligrams of phosphorus which is nutritious to the brain and 7 milligrams of iron which is strengthens the body in general and the heart in particular.
