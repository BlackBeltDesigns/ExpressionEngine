Forget about the error message, it is my mistake.

I downloaded a sample font from here: http://www.fontsupply.com/fonts/T/Times.html

The on a pure GD-implementation I tested what Ckirk suggested. Characters get shown correctly. The simple encoding conversion UTF-8 -> ISO-8859-15 seemingly works too for your example, but maybe there are thinks that I don’t know.

But with the font texb.ttf I have no success.

So, change the font, get Ckirk’s suggestion and fight again. grin

An amendment: I played with this simple script “Watermark with Text” with some minor modifications: http://www.9lessons.info/2011/11/php-image-and-text-watermark.html
