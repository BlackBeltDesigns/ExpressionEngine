airways,
Thanks for the quick reply.

Here’s my quick story…

I’ve been building this real-estate site using Joomla+Seblod, which is a powerful combination.  For a second real-estate site, I decided to purchase an EE license and build it simultaneously in ExpressionEngine so I can do a thorough comparison.

No question, creating templates and calling up the information I need anywhere I need it using tags and channel references is a huge plus.  Also, ExpressionEngine is terrific at allowing me to call “publish” or “gather” fields in combinations on the same page.

But ExpressionEngine is weaker in two crucial areas:
1. Depth of field types. 
2. Notifications.  I cannot quite understand how to handle notifications to the site admin and to the submitter after a form is submitted in ExpressionEngine.

So I guess my questions for ProForm come down to this:
1. Do you have a list of available field types in ProForm?
2. Do you have more detail on ProForm’s notification system?

Thanks,
Matthew
