I was wondering the same thing, actually. When I called EngineHosting a couple of weeks ago and got the answering machine, your xmas holiday message was still up. Also, I’ve sent an email to sales@enginehosting.com about another account and haven’t gotten a reply for a couple of days.

Our sites on EH are still running, so I know you’re not dead! But I’d love to hear from you….
