airways,
This looks terrific.  Yes, I am a big fan of the way ExpressionEngine separates the styling from the functions.

ProForm seems to be a nice expansion of the capabilities available in SafeCracker.

I’m assuming that you have plans for future development of ProForm?  Is there a place where users can discuss details and get involved in the development?

I want to establish a test case that ExpressionEngine can lead to the kind of site I have in mind.  My plan for now is to build a version of the real-estate site on my development domain, and if I can make the model work then that be the official site for this client.

I’m going to purchase ProForm and dig into it.

Thanks again,
Matthew
