Field types
Field types in ProForm decide how data is stored in the database, rather than how it is presented to the user. ProForm does not render the form for you, which allows you to retain 100% control over your markup, so you are free to set up any kind of UI for each field type as you wish. The built in field types are listed here: Field Types

The default template is just a reference, onto which you can add any kind of markup you need to. You could easily add CKEditor to the textarea fields, for instance, or load a jQuery UI Data Picker for particular fields.

So basically ProForm can handle really anything you want. It just may take a bit more tweaking in the front-end as any public facing form would.

Notifications
Notifications in ProForm are based on the same templates that you’re learning to love in EE itself. Any module or plugin tag can be used in ProForm to generate very complex notifications.

The email address to send notifications to can be set in one of three way.

1. In the form’s template code through the notify=“email@example.com|email2@example.com” param.

2. On the form’s settings you can specify a list of email addresses to send a notification to.

3. You can send notifications to email addresses entered on the form itself - for instance, to send a notification to the person who submitted it, or to allow the user to select someone to notify from a dropdown (I did this exact thing for a client recently).
