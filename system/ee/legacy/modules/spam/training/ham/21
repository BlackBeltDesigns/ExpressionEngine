There is an editable setting in the accessory that you can use to configure the location of the assets folder.

As far as the other issue goes, I’ve had one other report of this - I’d like to get it pegged.

Could you tell me what browser/version/ee-version you are using, and would you be willing to give me some troubleshooting context?  My guess is that a script error on the page is stopping change events from firing.  I’d love to troubleshoot this, but I can’t seem to reproduce the problem.

Many thanks,
