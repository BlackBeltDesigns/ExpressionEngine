Hi Matt,

Looks nice. Any documentation on how to install though?

I placed the theeditor folder into system > expressionengine > third_party and the assets folder I just placed directly into my root folder of the ExpressionEngine install as I wasnâ€™t too sure where it should go.

I can see by going to a template that the scripts are showing in the source but nothing is different with the template editor except that I can no longer resize it.

Best wishes,

Mark
