Rob,

Right now you can easily do this with a SP Table Select field set to use the exp_proform_forms table and with both fields set to form_name (due to what appears to be a bug in SP Table Select). At some point, I’ll be creating a custom fieldtype that will do this for you without requiring SP Table Select.

If this field was named “page_form_name”, in your page template you would get the form attached to a page by calling the tag like so:

{exp:proform:form form_name="{page_form_name}"}
...
{/exp:proform:form} 
At some point I am planning to create an additional field type, or a module publish tab, that will allow you to create a form directly on an entry. That is some time down the road however as it will require reworking the way that the form editor works to fit into a publish page.
