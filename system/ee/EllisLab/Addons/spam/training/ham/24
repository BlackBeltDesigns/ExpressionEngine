I tried to test a text watermark with pure GD functions, but this is what I got: “Message: imagettftext(): Could not find/open font”. I am sure that font path is correct.

Ubuntu 13.10, 64-bit, php 5.5.3

Something similar has been reported: http://ellislab.com/forums/viewthread/216459/

I’ll make a check with a different font.
