I don’t currently have an online demo available, however I am planning to release a video demo showing ProForm’s capabilities at some point in the near future.

The documentation here may help you out a bit: http://metasushi.com/docs/proform/

I can also answer any specific questions about ProForm’s functionality of course. Let me know what you need to do.
