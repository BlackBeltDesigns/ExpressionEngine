Here is one solution for your reference, use Kvisoft PDF flip page software to convert PDF to flip brochure, and then upload the output publication to website server, embedded the flip brochure on the webpage, so people can click the fullscreen button to flip browse the pages just like flip a book on a pop-up window. Hope this helps!
