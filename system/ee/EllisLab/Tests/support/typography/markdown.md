Markdown
-------------

...is <span>really</span> <em>just</em> ordinary text, *plain and simple*. How is it good for you?

- You just **type naturally**, and the result looks good.
- You **don't have to worry** about clicking formatting buttons.
  - Or fiddling with indentation. (Two spaces is all you need.)

<div class="something">This shouldn't be parsed in Markdown with the no_markup
	option set.</div>

We also have a URL here that has spaces in it: [Marked App Menu](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Marked%20App%20Menu).

To see what else you can do with Markdown (including **tables**, **images**, **numbered lists**, and more) take a look at the [Cheatsheet][1]. And then try it out by typing in this box!
